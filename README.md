# BigMartSalesPrediction

This repository delves into a comprehensive exploration and analysis of Big Mart's sales data, culminating in the development of regression models for future sales prediction.

## Key Components:

* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
  *  In-depth examination of the sales data to uncover patterns, trends, and relationships between variables.
  * Data cleaning and pre-processing to ensure model accuracy.
  * Visualization techniques (e.g., histograms, scatter plots) to gain insights into data distribution and potential correlations.
    
* **Regression Modeling:**
  * Implementation of various regression algorithms (e.g., linear regression, XGB regression, random forest regression) to predict future sales.
  * Evaluation of model performance using metrics like R-squared after Cross Validation.
  * Model selection based on performance and interpretability.
 
***Feel free to explore the code, visualizations, and documentation to learn more about the project's findings and how it can be adapted to your specific needs.***
